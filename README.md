Plot2Kill plotting library for D
================================

Plot2Kill was originally written by David Simcha and offers basic
functionality for displaying and saving plots, biased towards statistical
analysis.

This fork has been updated to compile with recent GtkD versions and Dub.


Licensing
---------

Plot2Kill is licensed under the Boost license. You may not be able to use it
under such permissive terms if you link to a copylefted GUI library. For
example, GTK and gtkD are LGPL, which adds some (minor) requirements to
executables that link to it, but imposes no burdens on source code that simply
refers to the LGPL'd library. (The sources to this project, in isolation,
would be considered a "work that uses the library" and fall outside the scope
of the LGPL.)
